# MicrosatelliteGenotypingFromBam

With the advent of next generation sequencing, SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) have replaced microsatellites as the mainstream genetic marker. These SNP data sets are typically generated by mapping short sequencing reads to a reference genome (which generates bam-files), by subsequently using the information in the bam-files to call genotypes (i.e., determine for each site whether it is most likely homozygous reference, heterozygous, or homozygous alternative), and by lastly selecting the sites where for the given subset of individuals two or more alleles (i.e., A,C,G,T) are present. 

However, instead of extracting SNP data from the information stored in bam-files, why not extract microsatellite data? Given the relatively high mutation rate and allelic richness of microsatellites, one could even argue that microsatellites are a more informative genetic marker than biallelic SNPs. While traditional microsatellite studies are based on a limited number of markers (typically less than 30), whole genome resequencing data potentially contains information for many thousands of microsatellites.

## Workflow overview

The pipeline presented here extracts microsatellite data from input bam-files. The prerequisite is that the short read data has been mapped against a reference genome which has not been masked for repetitive genomes. Furthermore, the sequencing data should at least be 10x (preferably 20x or more), and the read lengths preferably not shorter than 150 bp.

The procedure to produce a microsatellite data set from bam-files involves computer work only (not wet lab stuff), and consists of the following five steps:

1. microsatellite loci selection: detect and select a set of microsatellite loci in a reference genome
2. microsatellite data extraction: extract the selected microsatellite loci from all individual genomes
3. allele scoring: count for each microsatellite locus the number of reads supporting each allele  
4. genotype calling: convert count data into genotypes using a decision tree
5. data quality filtering and analyses 

Albeit entirely computer-based, in a way each step of this pipeline resembles steps in the traditional wet-lab protocol of a microsatellite study, namely: 1.) primer selection/design, 2.) target-specific DNA-amplification through PCR, 3.) allele scoring through capillary electrophoresis, 4.) genotype calling using a decision tree, and .5) data quality filtering and analyses.     

## Step 1. Select a set of microsatellite loci

Microsatellites in a reference genome can be detected using the software TRFfinder, by running the command:

*./trf409.linux64 mygenome.fa 2 7 7 80 10 50 6 -d -h &*

The -h flag is needed to surpress output files we do not need (which otherwise will overload your directory).

The output file will be named 'mygenome.fa.2.7.7.80.10.50.6.dat.' To select microsatellites tetranucleotide microsatellites with a repeat length of 7 to 9 units and an alignment score of 100, and to store the information for these loci in BED-format, run the script 'FASTA_findmicrosats_TRFoutput2BED.sh'. 

You are free to edit the script if you want to select loci with different period and/or repeat lengths. Keep in mind, though, that read length imposes an upper limit to the length of microsatellites which can be reliably genotyped, and also consider that tetranucleotides can be more reliably genotyped than dinucleotides (see step 3).

## Step 2. Extract selected microsatellites from genomes 

In traditional microsatellite studies, PCR and tailor-made primers are used to selectively amplify the regions of interest, which effectively serves to extract the microsat loci out of the genomes. In this bioinformatics pipeline we use a different approach to extract the microsats: namely, we downsample the bam-files by only keeping reads which overlap with the selected microsatellites. In other words: we discard all reads which do not overlap with a microsatellite region (which will be the vast majority). The small bam-files which are created by this step are much faster to process in the subsequent steps than if using the original bam-file containing all reads.

To downsample the BAM-files, edit and run the script 'BAM_microsats_select.sh'. This script expects to find the bed-file created in the previous step, as well as a txt.file listing all input bam-files.
The script will generate new bam-files with the same prefix as the original bam-files and with the suffix 'allmicrosats.bam'. The script will not edit the original bam-files.

## Step 3. Allele scoring

The Unix script 'BAM_microsats_getscores.sh' discard reads with a truncated microsatellite and subsequently determines repeat lengths in the retained reads. The output is stored in a file called 'mymicrosat.reads.all_loci.txt'. This file lists for each sample and for each locus the number of reads observed for a given repeat length (default range: 1 to 40).

***Figure 1. Microsatellite scoring.*** *Above: reads overlapping with a tetranucleotide microsatellite with the repeat ATCT. All occurrences of the repeat 'ATCT' are highlighted in red. Below: single and double repeats have been replaced with KKKK and KKKKKKKK respectively, strings consisting of three or more repeats have been replaced with an underscore, and reads with truncated strings have been discarded. Allele counts can be obtained by counting for each read the number of underscores and by dividing this number by the period length (4). For this particular locus and individual, the combined read depth is 12.* 

## Step 4. Genotype calling

The R script 'BAM_microsats_genotyping.inR.txt' reads the data stored in the file 'mymicrosat.reads.all_loci.txt' (created in the previous step), and infers genotypes using a simple set of (admittedly arbitrary) rules. Specifically, alleles with a read depth below three were assumed to be 'genotyping errors' (or 'stutter alleles', if you like). In cases where more than two alleles remained, the two best supported alleles (highest read depths) were chosen. In cases where the second and third option alleles were supported by equal amounts of reads, the locus was scored homozygous for the best supported allele.

***Figure 2. Allelic depths.*** *Shown are allelic depths for a randomly chosen locus and a random subset of individuals. For instance, for individual ABC12 (topleft) there are 3 reads suggesting a repeat length of 10, and 3 reads suggesting a repeat length of 11. This individual will be genotyped as heterozygous 10/11. For individual ABC13 (below ABC12) there are 10 reads suggesting a repeat length of 7. This individual will be genotyped as homozygous 7/7.*
